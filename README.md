# HomeProjects
Home project checklist

Small project to create a way for my wife and I to detail the home projects we are working on.  
Gonig to create variables for each room of the house including outside and what we want to accomplish.
May include a buget line int for things that will require purchases not just cleaning and organizing items.

Also using this project to learn Visual Basic.
